# Jackson Vondemkamp — Portfolio (local dev)

This is a minimal Next.js site that displays your extracted resume text. It was scaffolded to emulate a large typographic portfolio layout.

Local dev:

```bash
cd /Users/jacksonvondemkamp/Desktop/Independent\ Work/jacksonvondemkamp.com
npm install
npm run dev
```

If `data/resume.txt` is missing, generate it with:

```bash
npm run export-resume
```
